.SH NAME
vdsmd \- Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager's host agent
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "service vdsmd start"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B VDSM
service is required by a
.B RHEV Manager
to manage RHEV Hypervisors
and Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts. VDSM manages and monitors the host's
storage, memory and networks as well as virtual machine creation, other host
administration tasks, statistics gathering, and log collection.

VDSM should be run as a daemon on each node managed by RHEV-M.
It answers XML-RPC calls from clients (mostly RHEV-M). 

.SH HOOKS
VDSM is extendible: it has hooks in strategic locations, where it executes
external scripts.
.B
Hooks API is new and is subject to future changes.
Currently-supported hooks have self-explanatory names:
    before_vm_start, after_vm_start,
    before_vm_cont, after_vm_cont,
    before_vm_pause, after_vm_pause,
    before_vm_hibernate, after_vm_hibernate,
    before_vm_dehibernate, after_vm_dehibernate,
    before_vm_migrate_source, after_vm_migrate_source,
    before_vm_migrate_destination, after_vm_migrate_destination,
    after_vm_destroy,
    before_vdsm_start, after_vdsm_stop.

Each hook executes the scripts under
.FN /usr/libexec/vdsm/hooks/<hook-name>/
in lexicographic order.

.SS Hook environment
Each hook script (except before_vdsm_start and after_vdsm_stop) inherit the
environment of the VDSM process, with an additional variable
.B _hook_domxml
which holds the path of libvirt's
.B domain xml
representation of the relevant virtual machine.
The uuid of the virtual machine may be deduced from that xml, but it is also
available as the environment variable
.B vmId.

On top of these, RHEV-M allows to set a collection of "custom parameters" for
each virtual machine.  Each of these parameters is provided to hooks as an
environment variable.

before_migration_destination (and before_dehibernation) hooks currently receive
the xml of the domain from the source host. The xml of the domain at the
destination will differ in various details.

.SS Hook execution
before_vdsm_start and after_vdsm_stop scripts are executed as user
.I root.
All the other hooks are executed as user
.I vdsm.

.B before_vm_start
scripts may edit the domain xml file (pointed by
.B _hook_domxml
) in order to change VDSM's definition of a
virtual machine before it reaches libvirt. As with all hooks, the China Store
Rule applies - if you break something, you own it. Any script can mess up
VDSM's operation badly. In particular, you may never change the uuid of the
domain, and should better know what you are doing if you remove a device from
the domain.

Standard error of hook scripts is collected into VDSM's log, which may be used
by scripts for debugging.

As a somewhat silly example, let us think of a script that warns when a
domain with too much memory is started on a host:

.nf
    #!/bin/bash

    mem=\`/usr/bin/xpath $_hook_domxml '/domain/memory/text()' 2> /dev/null\`

    if [ "$mem" -gt 1073741824 ]; then
        echo "Domain with more than Gb!" >&2
    fi

    exit 0
.fi

.SS Hook return code
Hook script must return one of the following return codes:
.PD 0
.TP
.B
0
the hook script ended successfully.
.TP
.B
1
the hook script failed, other hooks should be processed.
.TP
.B
2
the hook script failed, no further hooks should be processed.
.TP
.B
>2
reserved.
